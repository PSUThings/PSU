The SaturnPSU design is flawed. 

1 - The 9V voltage regulator is rated at 0.1 amp and insufficient to power the CD drive. 

2 - The 3.3V / 5V switch is also rated at 0.1 amp and insufficient for the power demands of the console. 

3 - There's no provision for Saturn console revisions that utilise 12V as opposed to 9V. 

The first issue is major. It prevents the stock CD drive of the Saturn from functioning. 1 amp is needed. This affects consoles with type A and B power supplies.
